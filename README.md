This portfolio is a collection of the 5 projects I have coded and am proudest of during my first semester at Jones College Prep.

Project #1: Bedtime Story

and descriptions and then taking all those inputs and entering them into a formulaic paragraph and 
creating a brand new story based on those inputs.

between a randomly generated number betweeen vcertain range of numbers and then will be told if
they have correctly or incorrectly guessed the randomly generated number. They can choose a difficulty,
have 3 chances to guess the number and are told whether or not they are close or far to the number.
